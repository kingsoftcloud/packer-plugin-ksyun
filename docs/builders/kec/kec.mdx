# Ksyun Image Builder (kec)

Type: `ksyun-kec`

The `ksyun-kec` Packer builder is able to create Ksyun Images backed by
instance storage as the root device.


## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the builder. In addition to
the items listed here, you will want to look at the general configuration
references for [Image](#image-configuration),
[DiskDevices](#disk-devices-configuration),
[Access](#access-configuration),
[Run](#run-configuration) and
[General](#general-configuration)
configuration references, which are
necessary for this build to succeed and can be found further down the page.

## Run Configuration

### Required:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the KsyunKecRunConfig struct in builder/kec/run_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `instance_type` (string) - Instance package type, if the instance package type is not specified when calling, the default value is I1.1A.

- `source_image_id` (string) - Source Image Id

- `instance_charge_type` (string) - PostPaidByDay or PostPaidByHour
  default is PostPaidByDay

  Example Hcl usage:
  ```hcl
   source_image_filter {
     platform     = "centos-7.5"
     name_regex   = "centos-7.5.*"

  the instance of starting the Jinshan cloud standard image
  default : false

- `local_volume_snapshot_id` (string) - Local Volume Snapshot Id

- `data_disk_gb` (int) - The data volume capacity is in GB. The capacity limit changes according to the definition of the instance package
  type. If it is not specified when calling, it is the minimum value of the corresponding instance package type.

  does not take effect.

- `user_data` (string) - The user-defined data provided for instance startup needs to be encoded in Base64 mode,

## Basic Example

Here is a basic example. It is completely valid but excludes the access keys:

### Example Usage

```hcl
packer {
  required_plugins {
    ksyun = {
      version = ">=0.1.0"
      source  = "github.com/kingsoftcloud/ksyun"
    }
  }
}

variable ak {
  type    = string
  default = "${env("KSYUN_ACCESS_KEY")}"
}

variable sk {
  type    = string
  default = "${env("KSYUN_SECRET_KEY")}"
}

source "ksyun-kec" "test" {
  access_key      = var.ak
  secret_key      = var.sk
  region          = "cn-shanghai-2"
  image_name      = "packer_test"
  source_image_id = "IMG-05f198b3-9df6-4f94-a3e3-dcee4b48c4aa"
  instance_type   = "N3.1B"
  ssh_username    = "root"

  # 此参数用于跳过ssh
  # communicator                = "none"

  # 如需使用ssh，须保证网络能通，如果不在同一个网络环境下就要挂公网ip
  associate_public_ip_address = true

  ssh_clear_authorized_keys = true

  # 此参数为true时，data_disks的硬盘不会打快照加入镜像
  image_ignore_data_disks = true

  data_disks {
    data_disk_type = "SSD3.0"
    data_disk_size = 50
  }

  # 复制镜像到以下region
  image_copy_regions = ["cn-beijing-6", "cn-guangzhou-1"]

  # 镜像复制后的名称, 不命名则使用原镜像的名称
  image_copy_names = ["copy-test"]

  # 开启镜像预热
  image_warm_up = true

  # 镜像共享给其他用户
  #  image_share_accounts = ["xxxxxxxx", "xxxxxxxx"]
}

build {
  sources = ["source.ksyun-kec.test"]
  provisioner "shell" {
    inline = ["sleep 10", "df -h"]
  }
}
```
