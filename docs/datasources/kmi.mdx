# Ksyun KMI Data Source

Type: `ksyun-kmi`

The Ksyun KMI data source will filter and fetch a Ksyun Images, and output all the Ksyun Machine images information that will
be then available to use in the [Ksyun builders](./).

-> **Note:** Data sources is a feature exclusively available to HCL2 templates.

Basic example of usage:

```hcl
data "ksyun-kmi" "foo" {
  access_key   = "ksyun access key"
  secret_key   = "ksyun secret key"
  region       = "cn-shanghai-2"
  platform     = "centos-7.5"
  name_regex   = "centos-7.5.*"
  image_source = "system" // import, copy, share, extend, system.
  most_recent  = true
}
```
This selects the most recent Centos 7.5 Ksyun Images from remote Ksyun. Note that the data source will fail unless
*exactly* one AMI is returned. In the above example, `most_recent` will cause this to succeed by selecting the newest image.

## Configuration Reference

### Required:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the AccessConfig struct in builder/access_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `access_key` (string) - Ksyun access key must be provided unless `profile` is set, but it can
  also be sourced from the `KSYUN_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable.

- `secret_key` (string) - Ksyun secret key must be provided unless `profile` is set, but it can
  also be sourced from the `KSYUN_SECRET_KEY` environment variable.

- `region` (string) - Ksyun region must be provided unless `profile` is set, but it can
  also be sourced from the `KSYUN_REGION` environment variable.

### Optional:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the KmiFilterOptions struct in builder/common_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `most_recent` (bool) - Selects the newest created image when true.
  This is most useful for selecting a daily distro build.

- `image_source` (string) - ImageSource Valid values are import, copy, share, extend, system.

- `name_regex` (string) - NameRegex A regex string to filter resulting images by name.
  (Such as: `^CentOS 7.[1-2] 64` means CentOS 7.1 of 64-bit operating system or CentOS 7.2 of 64-bit operating system,
  \"^Ubuntu 16.04 64\" means Ubuntu 16.04 of 64-bit operating system).

- `platform` (string) - Platform type of the image system.

## Output Data

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the DatasourceOutput struct in datasource/kmi/data.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `id` (string) - The ID of the image.

- `name` (string) - The name of the image.

- `creation_date` (string) - The date of creation of the image.

- `platform` (string) - Platform

- `image_source` (string) - Image Source

## Basic Example

Here is a basic example. It is completely valid but excludes the access keys:

### Example Usage

```hcl
packer {
  required_plugins {
    ksyun = {
      version = ">=0.1.0"
      source  = "github.com/kingsoftcloud/ksyun"
    }
  }
}

variable ak {
  type    = string
  default = "${env("KSYUN_ACCESS_KEY")}"
}

variable sk {
  type    = string
  default = "${env("KSYUN_SECRET_KEY")}"
}

data "ksyun-kmi" "foo" {
  access_key   = var.ak
  secret_key   = var.sk
  region       = "cn-shanghai-2"
  platform     = "centos-7.5"
  name_regex   = "centos-7.5.*"
  image_source = "system" // import, copy, share, extend, system.
  most_recent  = true
}


source "ksyun-kec" "test" {
  access_key      = var.ak
  secret_key      = var.sk
  region          = "cn-shanghai-2"
  image_name      = "packer_test"
  source_image_id = data.ksyun-kmi.foo.id
  instance_type   = "N3.1B"
  ssh_username    = "root"
}

build {
  sources = ["source.ksyun-kec.test"]
}
```
