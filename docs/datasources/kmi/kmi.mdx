# Ksyun KMI Data Source

Type: `ksyun-kmi`

The Ksyun KMI data source will filter and fetch a Ksyun Images, and output all the Ksyun Machine images information that will
be then available to use in the [Ksyun builders](./).

-> **Note:** Data sources is a feature exclusively available to HCL2 templates.

Basic example of usage:

```hcl
data "ksyun-kmi" "foo" {
  access_key   = "ksyun access key"
  secret_key   = "ksyun secret key"
  region       = "cn-shanghai-2"
  platform     = "centos-7.5"
  name_regex   = "centos-7.5.*"
  image_source = "system" // import, copy, share, extend, system.
  most_recent  = true
}
```
This selects the most recent Centos 7.5 Ksyun Images from remote Ksyun. Note that the data source will fail unless
*exactly* one AMI is returned. In the above example, `most_recent` will cause this to succeed by selecting the newest image.
