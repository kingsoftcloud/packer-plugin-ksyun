# Ksyun Image Builder (kec)

Type: `ksyun-kec`

The `ksyun-kec` Packer builder is able to create Ksyun Images backed by
instance storage as the root device.


## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the builder. In addition to
the items listed here, you will want to look at the general configuration
references for [Image](#image-configuration),
[DiskDevices](#disk-devices-configuration),
[Access](#access-configuration),
[Run](#run-configuration) and
[General](#general-configuration)
configuration references, which are
necessary for this build to succeed and can be found further down the page.

## Run Configuration

### Required:

- `source_image_id` (string) - Source Image Id

- `instance_charge_type` (string) - PostPaidByDay or PostPaidByHour
  default is PostPaidByDay

  	// parameter is not specified, the default value is InstanceId of the
  	// instance. It cannot begin with `http://` or `https://`.ter and can contain numerals, `.`, `_`, or `-`. The

  does not take effect.

- `user_data` (string) - The user-defined data provided for instance startup needs to be encoded in Base64 mode,
  and the maximum data size supported is 16kb
