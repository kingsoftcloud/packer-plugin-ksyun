- `source_image_filter` (ksyun.KmiFilterOptions) - Filters used to populate the `source_image_id` field.
  
  Example Hcl usage:
  ```hcl
   source_image_filter {
     platform     = "centos-7.5"
     name_regex   = "centos-7.5.*"
     image_source = "system" # import, copy, share, extend, system.
     most_recent  = true
   }
  ```
  `most_recent` will cause this to succeed by selecting the newest image.

- `system_disk_type` (string) - Local_SSD || SSD3.0 || EHDD

- `system_disk_size` (int) - System Disk Size

- `data_disks` ([]KsyunEbsDataDisk) - `data_disks` is able to create Ksyun Kec instance with data disks.
  Example Hcl usage:
  ```hcl
    data_disks {
     data_disk_type = "SSD3.0"
     data_disk_size = 50
     data_disk_snapshot_id = "data disk snapshot id" # creat disk with a data disk snapshot existed.
   }
  ```

- `instance_name` (string) - Display name of the instance, which is a string of 2 to 128 Chinese or
  English characters. It must begin with an uppercase/lowercase letter or
  a Chinese charac displayed on the Alibaba Cloud console. If this
  	// parameter is not specified, the default value is InstanceId of the
  	// instance. It cannot begin with `http://` or `https://`.ter and can contain numerals, `.`, `_`, or `-`. The
  instance name is packer_kec_instance

- `sriov_net_support` (bool) - This parameter needs to satisfy the following two conditions:
  IO optimized I1, calculation optimized C1, and IO optimized I2 are more than 8C packages
  We use the standard image improved by Jinshan cloud or the user-defined image made by
  the instance of starting the Jinshan cloud standard image
  default : false

- `local_volume_snapshot_id` (string) - Indicating whether needs local volume snapshot with creating kec instance

- `data_disk_gb` (int) - The data volume capacity is in GB. The capacity limit changes according to the definition of the instance package
  type. If it is not specified when calling, it is the minimum value of the corresponding instance package type.
  When the instancetype is a general-purpose host N1, N2, N3 or a local nvme I4, this parameter
  does not take effect.

- `user_data` (string) - The user-defined data provided for instance startup needs to be encoded in Base64 mode,
  and the maximum data size supported is 16kb
