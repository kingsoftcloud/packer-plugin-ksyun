- `image_copy_names` ([]string) - The image name in copied regions

- `image_warm_up` (bool) - Set the image as warm-up for fast boot

- `tags` (map[string]string) - Key/value pair tags applied to the destination image.

- `tag` ([]{key string, value string}) - Same as [`tags`](#tags) but defined as a singular repeatable

  [`dynamic_block`](/packer/docs/templates/hcl_templates/expressions#dynamic-blocks)
  will allow you to create those programatically.
